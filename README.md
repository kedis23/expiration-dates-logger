# expiration-dates-logger
A python app that logs expiration dates

The app could be developed using a combination of python programming language and a suitable framework, such as Django or Flask. The app would need to include a user-friendly interface that allows users to input and manage expiry dates for different products, as well as a database to store the expiry date information. The app could also include features such as notifications and alerts to remind users when products are approaching their expiry date, and reporting and analysis tools to help users monitor and manage their expiry dates more effectively.
